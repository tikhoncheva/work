+-  Sort interviews time in decreasing order
    Plan first lang interviews and then fill the gaps with short ones
    
+- Use week plan insted of a day plan


+ allow interviewers to stay at the end of the day to overnight in the village they currently are

Ver 02

  Corrected erros:
  + typ0 households require 10 min independent on number of persons
  + typ1 households must be visited only one time as long interviews (25 min pro person), other two times as short interviews (10 min)
  
  New approach:
    1. distribute long interviews uniformly in 3 periods
    2. plan visiting weeks for long interviewers in each period, full free time with short interviews
       adopt week plan of the first period in other two periods
    3. make week plan for each interviewer (first period only) TODO
      adopt week plans from first period for the second and the third	TODO
    4. make day plans	TODO
    
    
Ver02.01

  New approach:
    1. Plan long interview times as in previous version
    2. Plan households for each day independent on the interviewer
    3. Asssign interviewrs to day plans

    
    ToDo: better sorting of villages/hh
          allow to stay over night
          split too longs interviews
          
 Old approach (week assignments):
   do not close bins(days)
   
 Common problem: split too long interviews
